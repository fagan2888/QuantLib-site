<h1 class="center">QuantLib-Python installation on Linux</h1>
<h4 class="center">Luigi Ballabio</h4>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>The following assumes that you already installed
QuantLib. Instructions for that are available
at <a href="http://quantlib.org/install/linux.shtml">http://quantlib.org/install/linux.shtml</a>.</p>

<h2>QuantLib-Python Installation</h2>

<h3>Installation from a released version</h3>

<p>You can download released QuantLib-SWIG versions from the SourceForge download page 
  at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantlib/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantlib/files/</a>; look for the files under the <code>other languages</code> folder in any of the versioned folders under <code>QuantLib</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have the tarball, extract it by executing:</p>
<pre>
tar xzf QuantLib-SWIG-1.7.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>(1.7 is the most recent version at the time of this writing; you
might have downloaded another one.) This creates a
folder <code>QuantLib-SWIG-1.7</code>; enter it and configure QuantLib by
executing:</p>
<pre>
  cd QuantLib-SWIG-1.7
  ./configure
</pre>

<p>After configuration, you can just run</p>
<pre>
  make -C Python
  sudo make -C Python install
</pre>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, working from a released tarball doesn't
require you to have SWIG installed.</p>

<p>There are a couple of caveats to the above. The first is that
the <code>./configure</code> command will need to
invoke <code>quantlib-config</code> (which was installed with
QuantLib) to find out what flags should be passed to the compiler and
linker; they will also include the additional include directories you
might have specified when you built QuantLib, so you'll be covered
even if you have, say, Boost in a non-standard place. This means
that <code>quantlib-config</code> must be in your path.</p>

<p>The second is that, unfortunately, at this time <code>make
install</code> ignores any prefix you might pass
to <code>./configure</code> and always installs to the default
location, which requires you to use <code>sudo</code> as I wrote
above. If you don't have admin rights, you'll have to look into
<code>Python/Makefile</code> and pass your prefix
to <code>setup.py.</code></p>

<p>Of course, you'll also need the Python development files installed
(that is, <code>python.h</code> and so on). They might be available by
default; but if not, you'll have to figure out how to get them. On
Ubuntu, for instance, you would install them with:</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install python-dev
</pre>
<p>Similar packages should be available for most other
distributions.</p>

<p>Once you're done, you can try to run a few examples to check your
installation. To do this, you can simply execute:</p>
<pre>
  make -C Python check
</pre>


<h3>Installation from a git repository</h3>

<p>If you want to compile from a checkout of a git repository (such as
the official one
at <a href="https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib-swig">https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib-swig</a>,
or a fork of it that you might have created) you'll need an additional
step at the beginning of the process. Before running
the <code>./configure</code> script, you'll have to create it by
executing</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh
</pre>
<p>To do this, you'll need automake, autoconf and libtool. Again,
they're packaged for most Linux distributions; on Ubuntu, you would
get them by running</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install automake autoconf libtool
</pre>
<p>After the execution of <code>./autogen.sh</code>, the installation
proceeds as in the previous section. Note, though, that in this case
you'll need SWIG available; you can download and install it
from <a href="http://swig.org">http://swig.org</a> or, again, get it
packaged for your distribution.</p>
