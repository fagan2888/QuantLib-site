<h1>QuEP 2: reimplementing boundary conditions for FD models</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Boundary conditions (BC) are an essential part of a finite-difference 
model.</p>

<p>In the current implementation, BC:s are implemented as a simple structure 
with a enumerated type tag and a value. The logic of the boundary condition 
itself is implemented in the TridiagonalOperator class. This has drawbacks in 
terms of both model logic and extensibility.</p>

<p>A new implementation is proposed which encapsulates the logic of the 
BC into a polymorphic BoundaryCondition class which is part of the 
finite-difference model as much as the differential operator and 
the time scheme.</p>


<h2>Current implementation</h2>
<p>The present implementation of FiniteDiffrenceMethod contains an Evolver, which in turn contains an Operator. BC:s are set to the operator before the latter is passed to the model which in turn passes it to the evolver. Setting a BC immediately modifies an operator; also, BC:s are stored in the operator and applied to the input and/or output array when the applyTo() or solveFor() methods are invoked.</p>

<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<p>There is no clean encapsulation of the BC logic. The operator and the 
input/output arrays are modified at different times and different places 
in the code. Also, there is no clear separation between the BC logic and the 
linear algebra calculations which form the core of the applyTo() and 
solveFor() methods.</p>

<p>The code which applies the BC:s is a switch construct which executes 
different code depending on the enumerated BC type tag. This seriously 
compromises the extensibility of the code, e.g., the addition of new BC types 
to the framework.</p>

<p>Another logic flaw is present, namely, BC:s are set and modifications are 
applied to the operator D which is passed to the model. Instead, they should 
only be applied to the operator which transforms the array at a given time 
step into the array at the next step. Such operator is not D itself but 
rather I+dt*D or a similar one depending on the chosen time scheme. For this 
same reason, care must be taken that the implementation of the operator 
algebra propagates the BC:s from D to (dt*D) to (I+(dt*D)).</p>


<h2>Proposed implementation</h2>
<p>A polymorphic BoundaryCondition class is defined which encapsulates the BC 
logic. Its interface is defined so that it should be able to manage different 
kind of required modifications, namely, ones that should be applied before 
and/or after the application of the operator or its inverse. Such methods act 
simultaneously on the operator and the right-hand side of the equation. </p>

<p>The BC:s are passed to the model together with the operator and are stored 
into the evolver. It is the responsibility of the evolver to call the 
appropriate BC methods inside its step() method.</p>

<p>Finally, the TridiagonalOperator would not be concerned with BC:s. Its 
applyTo() and solveFor() methods would only implement the corresponding 
linear algebra calculations.</p>

<p>The framework would be implemented as in the following pseudo-code:
<pre>
class FiniteDifferenceMethod {
  public:
    FiniteDifferenceMethod(const Operator& L, ??? boundaryConditions)
    : evolver_(L,boundaryConditions) { ... }
    ...
  private:
    Evolver evolver_;
};

class ForwardEuler {
  public:
    ForwardEuler(const Operator& L, ??? boundaryConditions)
    : L_(L), boundaryConditions_(boundaryConditions) { ... }
    void step(Array& a, Time t) {
        ... // set time if needed
        // actual operator is O = I-dt*L
        for every boundary condition
            bc.applyBeforeApplying(O);
        a = O.applyTo(a);
        for every boundary condition
            bc.applyAfterApplying(a);
    }
};

class BackwardEuler {
  public:
    BackwardEuler(const Operator& L, ??? boundaryConditions)
    : L_(L), boundaryConditions_(boundaryConditions) { ... }
    void step(Array& a, Time t) {
        ... // set time if needed
        // actual operator is O = I+dt*L
        for every boundary condition
            bc.applyBeforeSolving(O,a);
        a = O.solveFor(a);
        for every boundary condition
            bc.applyAfterSolving(a);
    }
};

class CrankNicolson {
  public:
    CrankNicolson(const Operator& L, ??? boundaryConditions)
    : L_(L), boundaryConditions_(boundaryConditions) { ... }
    void step(Array& a, Time t) {
        ... // set time if needed
        // actual operators are O1 = I-(dt/2)*L and O2 = I+(dt/2)*L
        for every boundary condition
            bc.applyBeforeApplying(O1);
        a = O1.applyTo(a);
        for every boundary condition
            bc.applyAfterApplying(a);
        for every boundary condition
            bc.applyBeforeSolving(O2,a);
        a = O2.solveFor(a);
        for every boundary condition
            bc.applyAfterSolving(a);
    }
};
</pre>
</p>

<p>The missing piece in the above code concerns the way to pass the BC:s to a 
model. This must take into account that we do not know in advance their 
number even in 1-D models, much less in 2-D or higher.</p>

<p>One possibility would be to pass a container of BC:s, e.g., a std::vector 
or a std::list. In this case, the constructor of a model would be implemented 
as
<pre>
class FiniteDifferenceMethod {
  public:
    FiniteDifferenceMethod(const Operator& L, 
                           const std::list&lt;Handle&lt;BoundaryCondition> >& bc)
    : evolver_(L,bc) { ... }
    ...
};
</pre>
</p>

<p>Another would be to pass to the model one BC which represents the set of 
all BC:s which are local to a part of the solution. The Composite pattern 
could be used to define such set as
<pre>
class CompositeBC : public BoundaryCondition {
  public:
    CompositeBC(const std::list&lt;Handle&lt;BoundaryCondition> >& bc = 
                std::list&lt;Handle&lt;BoundaryCondition> >())
    : bc_(bc) {}
    void add(const Handle&lt;BoundaryCondition>& c) {
        bc_.push_back(c);
    }
    void applyBeforeApplying(Operator& O) {
        for (every BC in the list)
            i->applyBeforeApplying(O);
    }
    ...
};
</pre>
In this case, the constructor of a model would be implemented as
<pre>
class FiniteDifferenceMethod {
  public:
    FiniteDifferenceMethod(const Operator& L, 
                           const Handle&lt;BoundaryCondition>& bc)
    : evolver_(L,bc) { ... }
    ...
};
</pre>
</p>
